# Flask-Login-1FA
This is a simple Flask-Login app that features 1 Factor Authentication.

Resetting password and other sensitive data is handled through one time link.

It is strongly adviced to use **Outlook** because **Gmail** requires setup of **Gmail API**.

Some _styles_ and _javascript_ were taken from [Codepen](https://codepen.io).
